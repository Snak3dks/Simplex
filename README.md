# Simplex
Classes for solving linear programming problems by simplex, dual-simplex and gomori methods.

# Implemented
- universal "input form" for all methods;
- universal "input params form" for simplex & dual-simplex methods;
- simplex abstract class (main methods);
- simple simplex method class (unique methods => extends simplex abstract class);
- double simplex method class (unique methods => extends simplex abstract class);

# TODO
- Implement Gomori method
